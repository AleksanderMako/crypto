# crypto



### Running 

```
if you are on a linux you can run the staticaly compiled file main with optional flags -nwallets for a custom  
number of wallets to be created with the server. In addition you can use the -p flag to set the port  
on which the server listens. Additionally you can build the docker image in the serve's directory.  
The default port of the server is 8080 so you will need to bind the docker port if you run it via Docker.
